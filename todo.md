- Focus: Incomes
- Task:
    - I need to be able to 
        - create an income account
        - set the estimated amounts
        - set the account to which the amount gets deposited
        - log an income entry with default entries
- Log
    - okay i can create income accounts
    - Accounts now have the concept of entitlements
    - I need a way to track whether or not incomes have been configured (just going to assume for now...)
    - After the income is created, we are going to redirect to a configure page
